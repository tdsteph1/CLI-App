![Image of product Table](https://github.com/tdsteph1/CLI-App/blob/master/images/pic1.png)

As you can see I've created the database called **Bamazon** and a table called **products** with the following columns: 

*item_id (unique id for each product)
*product_name (Name of product)
*department_name
*price (cost to customer)
*stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)
